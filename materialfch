 NOT the only method used for finding the optimal number of clusters for k-means clustering.
Decision Tree Classification DOES NOT results highly depend on homoscedasticity assumption being met.
One may overcome overfitting by hyperparameter optimization in case of Decision Tree.
Specificity is NOT the percentage of true positives in real positives.
P-values of Decision Tree Classifier coefficients can be easily obtained but are not reliable. - NO
The Gini coefficient in the root (very first) node is calculated as 2*p*(1-p) for binary classification, where p is
the percentage of 0s (or 1s) in the total dataset.
Decision Tree Regression importance measure indicates the percentage of Gini index decrease resulting from
the splits with the given feature.
